# What's new in Joplin 2.12

# Desktop

## Support for Apple Silicon

A new release is now available for Apple Silicon, which provides improve performances on this architecture.

## Rich Text editor

We decided to make several improvements and bug fixes on the Rich Text editor for this release. For example, plugin toolbar icons are now supported, and we improved how the editor handles text pasted from Word and other Office and LibreOffice applications for improved interoperability. Some small but welcome changes include a better handling for newlines and paragraphs, which is a feature that was frequently asked, and a better handling of automatic switch between light and dark mode.

All in all that's about 12 changes for the Rich Text editor in this release and more is coming!

## Share permissions

With Joplin Cloud Pro and Teams you can now have adjust the read and write permissions of the notebooks that you share. You can either allow other users to modify the notes, or to share it as read-only. This allows you to safely share a notebook, knowing it will not be accidentally modified by your friends or colleagues.

## Email to Note

Also with Joplin Cloud Pro and Teams you can now benefit from the the Email to Note feature. With this feature, you can save your emails in Joplin Cloud by forwarding your emails to your Joplin Cloud address. The subject of the email will become the note title, and the email body will become the note content. The note will be created inside a notebook called Inbox.

More information in the [Email to Note documentation](https://joplinapp.org/email%5C_to%5C_note/).

## Choose to resize an image or not

By default, when you add a large image, Joplin will ask you if you would like to shrink it down or not. With this new release, you now have the option to always ask, to always resize, or to never resize the image, giving you more flexibility and reducing the number of prompts in the app.

## Rotating log

Up until now, the logs could grow to become very large, and if you wanted to shrink them down you would have to manually delete them. With this new release, we now automatically handle logs by rotating them - once the log becomes large enough it is moved to an archive. And once the archive is older than a number of days, it is deleted.

## Mobile

Like the desktop app, the mobile apps benefits from the Share Permissions update, as well as the Email to Note feature for Joplin Cloud. There are also plenty of other improvements - all in all there's 23 bug fixes, enhancements and security fixes in this release.
